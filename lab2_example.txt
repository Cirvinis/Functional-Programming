Running and manual testing example:

1) Testing one by one:
    1. navigate to needed folder (/workspaces/fp-2024/src)
    2. ghci
    3. :l Lib2.hs
    4. Write commands with arguments

    Examples with expected output:
    ghci> Animal "Cat" "Tom" 5
    Animal {species = "Cat", name = "Tom", age = 5}
    ghci> parseAdd "ADD fish Jojo 1"
    Right (Add (Animal {species = "fish", name = "Jojo", age = 1}))

    ghci> let state = emptyState
    ghci> let query = parseQuery "list_animals"
    ghci> print query
    Right ListAnimals

------------

---Parts 2) and 3) are for testing with runREPL---

2) Testing with a list (starts with an emptyState - no animals in a list):
    1. navigate to needed folder (/workspaces/fp-2024/src)
    2. ghci
    3. :l Lib2.hs
    4. runREPL emptyState
    5. run commands, for example:
        ADD cat Tom 5
        ADD fish Jem 1
        ADD dog Max 3
        DELETE fish Jem 1
        DELETE cat Tom 5
        LIST
        exit

------------

3) Testing with a list (starts not with an emptyState - initial state is presented at the start):
    1. navigate to needed folder (/workspaces/fp-2024/src)
    2. ghci
    3. :l Lib2.hs
    4. runREPL emptyState
    5. define initial state, for example:
        let initialState = State [Animal "dog" "Max" 5, Animal "cat" "Tom" 3]
    6. runREPL initialState
    7. run commands, for example just like in 1) example

------------

Example command line session for 2) and 3 testing cases:

ghci> runREPL emptyState
>>> ADD cat Tom 5
Added animal: Animal {species = "cat", name = "Tom", age = 5}
>>> ADD fish Jem 1
Added animal: Animal {species = "fish", name = "Jem", age = 1}
>>> LIST
Current animals: [Animal {species = "fish", name = "Jem", age = 1},Animal {species = "cat", name = "Tom", age = 5}]
>>> ADD dog Max 3
Added animal: Animal {species = "dog", name = "Max", age = 3}
>>> DELETE fish Jem 1
Deleted animal: Animal {species = "fish", name = "Jem", age = 1}
>>> LIST
Current animals: [Animal {species = "dog", name = "Max", age = 3},Animal {species = "cat", name = "Tom", age = 5}]
>>> 

------------

---Part 4) is for testing with main---

    1. navigate to needed folder (/workspaces/fp-2024/src)
    2. Write "ghci Lib2.hs"
    3. Write "main"

------------

---Part 5) for making sure that tests from Spec.hs pass---
    1. Just write "stack test"
